## Review
I completed the Starting Point track from HackTheBox. It builds off of the principles that you learn in the Academy which I also finished. 
You can see my review here -> <http://tkyn.dev/HackTheBox-Academy-Review> (article not written yet)

It took my a little over 7 hours of work. I spread these sessions out in 2-3 hour blocks. 

If you read over the walkthroughs, have gone through the accompanying academy modules, and have a tiny bit of previous experience you will power straight through this.

Looking at it from a beginners standpoint (who this is made for) it seems like a very polished introduction to the very basics of pentesting.
