Hey, I’m Thomas.

I am currently working as a red team operator for a Fortune 100 financial institution. At 21 years old and based on the East Coast, I’ve dedicated the past few years to honing my craft.

This page is a space where I’ll share my learning experiences, challenges, projects, and research endeavors. I hope you enjoy the posts and hopefully learn something new.

Feedback is always welcome and appreciated!
